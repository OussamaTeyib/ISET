Readme (not yet)

Publish the project on github (Done)

*** no rsrc version ***
dael with wchars to accented lettres to it

Add an option to our main code for help (usage explanaition, etc). print matiers and coeff if needed. (write a code that convert a dep.bin into dep documentation)

add validated if moy > 10 and 3 mods are > 10

help option everywhere (at each input)

make a table template file


*** after finishing ***
** checks***
- check everything sperate and easy to edit. make the code extensiiiiiive. add a lot of coments
- handde the memory correctly (ACF rule, Valgrind) and make the code fast (ask for advices).
- document every program (add an option in your program to read its user doc and print it)
- add technical docs for eatch prog (take your time in that. may be a prog's doc in a week)

*** additional features ***
- make it muilti language (after finishing the project, may be in version 2.0, you must deal with ar right to left writing!!! and unicode chars).
- use a build like Make or for ur project instaid of 'build.c'

** rsrc version **
the code have resource bin files

IT IS SAID THAT to read the resources, you must use winpi or an alternative for other os (android = linux), so your code must detect the os it is running on

use only one main code, but there is something you modify beforer compiling to indicate the targeted departement
for ex: for 'gab', you modify the main code and set a var to 'gab' and then compile it (you may add this to run program, means it read a value and assign it to the var in main(may be using cmd arguments)), the code now will read the gab.bin file (if you could not write a code for each dep and merge it with its rsrc. but this is similar to our old progs, so no diffrent...)

write a txt that serve as usage manual for the next ossame(how to merge , how to use windress and all necessary things) and write a prog called run to do all of that, (is: compile our prog, use gcc, windress, set departement var).
ASk chatGPT about run programs, does they exists in real projects how they are called.

every thing is in binary format!! ;)

try to spLit it into diffrent files (eg, one for handling bin files other for calculating) and then merge all the src codes into one exe. (after you merge it with the rsc)

rsc file must be one and contains all of the departementes. (to facilitate merging it. search if we could merge 
lot of files). 

.exe for windows, as i think. (make alt for android, you can search for an extension for all OSes or you can compile using android if possible(may be clang doesn't have windress).

*** My future dream: **** 
build it using the winapi
